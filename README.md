# FAQ

## Common Questions

### Why does Tradingview show me different information than crypto-signal?

There are several reasons why the information provided by crypto-signal might differ from tradingview, and truthfully, we cannot be 100% certain why these differences exist. Below are some factors affecting indicators that may vary between crypto-signal and tradingview.

- tradingview will have more historical data and for some indicators this can make a [big difference](https://ta-lib.org/d_api/ta_setunstableperiod.html).

- tradingview uses a rolling 15 minute timeframe which means that the data they are analyzing can be more recent than ours by a factor of minutes or hours depending on what candlestick timeframe you are using.

- tradingview may collect data in a way that means the timeperiods we have may not line up with theirs, which can have an effect on the analysis. This seems unlikely to us, but stranger things have happened.

### So if it doesn't match Tradingview how do you know your information is accurate?

The foundation of crypto-signal's technical analysis is TA-Lib, an open source technical analysis project that began in 1999. This library has been utilized in numerous technical analysis projects over the past two decades and remains one of the most trusted open source libraries for analyzing candlestick data.
